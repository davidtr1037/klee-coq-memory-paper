\subsection{Setup}
Each mode is run using the following configuration:
The search heuristic is set to DFS,
the timeout is set to one hour,
the memory limit is set to 4GB,
and the SMT solver is set to STP 2.3.3~\cite{stp}.
In all the modes, we measure the following metrics:
analysis time, number of explored paths, and number of executed instructions.
In the \proofopt mode,
we use \coqc to validate the generated proofs,
and we measure the \emph{proof time}, \ie the time required to compile the proof using \coqc,
and the \emph{proof size}, \ie the size of the compiled proof file (\code{.vo} file) created by \coqc.
We performed our experiments on Ubuntu 24.04,
equipped with Intel Core i9-9900 and 32GB of RAM.
