% TODO: goal: safety proofs using SE? certifying SE?

% problem: modern SE tools don't provide formal guarantees
% problem: providing formal safety guarantees for SE tools, so can't be used for verification / proving program safety
% in particular, if one is interested in verification / proving safety, then ...

% some approaches are based on extraction
% but applied in rather simplistic settings

% some approaches are based on proof-logging (perform soem form of proof logging), that...
% which generate program specific proofs during the analysis (symbolic execution)
% but applied only for a small subset of LLVM with integers / no support for memory / no support for real-world programs with memory
% but has not been applied yet to real-world programs with memory, etc.

% the first tool that can generate machined-checked safety proofs for programs with memory / includes memory modeling
% our approach is based on proof logging
% implementation: LLVM with memory / KLEE / Rocq
% applied on real-world programs
