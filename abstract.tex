% TODO: goal: safety proofs using SE? certifying SE?
% TODO: first?

%Symbolic execution (\SE) is a program analysis technique that executes the program with symbolic inputs.
Modern symbolic execution (\SE) tools are mainly designed for applicability and performance,
however, they do not provide formal guarantees for the correctness of their analysis results.
In particular,
if the goal is program verification, then relying on such unverified \SE tools is insufficient.
%One approach is to derive a verified \SE tool using extraction from proof assistants,
%but this was applied only in rather simplistic settings.
One approach to address this challenge is \emph{proof logging},
which works by instrumenting the \SE tool to generate a safety proof that is specific to the analyzed program.
%\ie they generate during the analysis proofs that are specific to the program under test,
However, proof logging has been applied so far only in relatively simplistic settings and has not been applied yet to real-world programs involving memory operations.
% our approach is based on proof logging
In this paper,
we present an approach for applying proof logging to memory-manipulating programs,
extending \SE with the ability to generate safety proofs for this class of programs.
We developed a \coq formalization of a subset of \llvm with memory instructions,
and extended \klee to generate safety proofs based in this formalization.
% TODO: approach?
We evaluated our approach on APIs from real-world benchmarks,
and found previously unknown memory-modeling issues in \klee.
