\section{Related Work}

The proof-logging approach proposed by Trabish et al.~\cite{klee-rocq} is restricted to a subset of \llvm with integers,
whereas our approach extends support to memory operations, making it applicable to more realistic programs.
Lundberg et al.~\cite{lundberg2024proof} use symbolic execution to produce functional correctness proofs for P4 programs using HOL4.
% TODO: no memory modeling...
They devise a symbolic execution algorithm that outputs a collection of theorems that can be used to prove properties about the analysis results.

% TODO: shorten
Correnson et al.~\cite{fse23wise} a formally verified symbolic bug finder for a toy WHILE-style language in \coq.
Their implementation does not support memory operations,
and their formalization is coupled with a specific search heuristic (BFS).

% TODO: needed?
%The approach proposed by~\cite{icfp22:keuchel} is similar to the work mentioned above,
%but based on axiomatic semantics instead.

% TODO: foundational tools: WISE, Veil, Loom, ...

% veil

% providing both pushbutton verification for decidable fragments of first-order logic and the full power
% of a modern higher-order proof assistant for when automation falls short.

% Veil allows for seamless interaction between automated and human-assisted proofs, all done in Lean, 
% allowing one to establish system specifications that are not expressible in first-order logic, and, thus, are beyond the reach of existing automated tools.

Veil~\cite{veil} is a foundational program verifier developed in Lean~\cite{moura2021lean}.
It provides automated verification for decidable fragments of first-order logic,
and when the automated verification fails, it fallbacks to an interactive verification mode using the proof assistant.
It was evaluated on concurrent and distributed algorithms.

% LOOM
% foundational: provide strong guarantees that the result of successful verification they report is consistent with the runtime behaviour of the respective program that has been verified in it
% Symbolic Execution with Angelic Non-Determinism

% a Lean-based framework for implementing multimodal program verifiers that enjoy foundational correctness guarantees and provide support for automated proofs.
% derived: veil 2 / velvet (supports arrays)
