Trabish et al.~\cite{klee-rocq} propose an approach for generating machine-checked safety proofs using symbolic execution.
Their approach supports only a subset of \llvm with integers,
while our approach supports memory operations,
making it applicable in more realistic settings.

Correnson et al.~\cite{fse23wise} formalize a Coq framework with concrete and symbolic semantics of a small prototype language.
Based on this framework, they extract an executable OCaml implementation of a symbolic execution engine.
Their implementation does not support memory operations, advanced search heuristics, SMT optimizations, and other performance optimizations.
In addition, their formalization is coupled with a specific search heuristic (BFS),
while our approach is agnostic to the underlying search heuristic.
% TODO: do we need this one?
The approach proposed by~\cite{icfp22:keuchel} is similar to the work mentioned above,
but based on axiomatic semantics instead.
