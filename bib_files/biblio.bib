abstract="We address the problem of error detection for programs that take recursive data structures and arrays as input. Previously we proposed a combination of symbolic execution and model checking for the analysis of such programs: we put a bound on the size of the program inputs and/or the search depth of the model checker to limit the search state space. Here we look beyond bounded model checking and consider state matching techniques to limit the state space. We describe a method for examining whether a symbolic state that arises during symbolic execution is subsumed by another symbolic state. Since the number of symbolic states may be infinite, subsumption is not enough to ensure termination. Therefore, we also consider abstraction techniques for computing and storing abstract states during symbolic execution. Subsumption checking determines whether an abstract state is being revisited, in which case the model checker backtracks---this enables analysis of an under-approximation of the program behaviors. We illustrate the technique with abstractions for lists and arrays. We also discuss abstractions for more general data structures. The abstractions encode both the shape of the program heap and the constraints on numeric data. We have implemented the techniques in the Java PathFinder tool and we show their effectiveness on Java programs. This paper is an extended version of Anand et al. (Proceedings of SPIN, pp. 163--181, 2006).",

@InProceedings{PPoPP:GK08,
   abstract    = {Transactional memory (TM) is perceived as an appealing
                 alternative to critical sections for general purpose
                 concurrent programming. Despite the large amount of
                 recent work on TM implementations, however, very little
                 effort has been devoted to precisely define what
                 guarantees these implementations should provide. A formal
                 description of such guarantees is necessary in order to
                 check the correctness of TM systems, as well as to
                 establish TM optimality results and inherent trade-offs.
                 This paper presents opacity, a candidate correctness
                 criterion for TM implementations. We define opacity as a
                 property of concurrent transaction histories and give its
                 graph theoretical interpretation. Opacity captures
                 precisely the correctness requirements that have been
                 intuitively described by many TM designers. Most TM
                 systems we know of do ensure opacity. At a very first
                 approximation, opacity can be viewed as an extension of
                 the classical database serializability property with the
                 additional requirement that even non-committed
                 transactions are prevented from accessing inconsistent
                 states. Capturing this requirement precisely, in the
                 context of general objects, and without precluding
                 pragmatic strategies that are often used by modern TM
                 implementations, such as versioning, invisible reads,
                 lazy updates, and open nesting, is not trivial. As a use
                 case of opacity, we prove the first lower bound on the
                 complexity of TM implementations. Basically, we show that
                 every single-version TM system that uses invisible reads
                 and does not abort non-conflicting transactions requires,
                 in the worst case, Î©(k) steps for an operation to
                 terminate, where k is the total number of objects shared
                 by the transactions. This (tight) bound precisely
                 captures an inherent trade-off in the design of TM
                 systems. The bound also highlights a fundamental gap
                 between systems in which transactions can be fully
                 isolated from the outside environment, e.g., databases or
                 certain specialized transactional languages, and systems
                 that lack such isolation capabilities, e.g., general TM
                 frameworks.},

We further describe our efficient implementation of the model in a free open-source project Bugst. Experimental results provide empirical evidence that the implemented memory model effectively tackles the variable storage-referencing problem of symbolic execution.",

The framework uses annotations in the form of method specifications and loop invariants. We present a novel iterative technique that uses invariant strengthening and approximation for discovering these loop invariants automatically. The technique handles different types of data (e.g. boolean and numeric constraints, dynamically allocated structures and arrays) and it allows for checking universally quantified formulas. Our framework is built on top of the Java PathFinder model checking toolset and it was used for the verification of several non-trivial Java programs.",

    abstract = {We present a method to verify the correctness of parallel programs that perform complex numerical computations, including computations involving floating-point arithmetic. The method requires that a sequential version of the program be provided, to serve as the specification for the parallel one. The key idea is to use model checking, together with symbolic execution, to establish the equivalence of the two programs.},

    abstract = {We introduce a new technique for inferring program invariants that uses symbolic states generated by symbolic execution. Symbolic states, which consist of path conditions and constraints on local variables, are a compact description of sets of concrete program states and they can be used for both invariant inference and invariant verification. Our technique uses a counterexample-based algorithm that creates concrete states from symbolic states, infers candidate invariants from concrete states, and then verifies or refutes candidate invariants using symbolic states. The refutation case produces concrete counterexamples that prevent spurious results and allow the technique to obtain more precise invariants. This process stops when the algorithm reaches a stable set of invariants.  We present SymInfer, a tool that implements these ideas to automatically generate invariants at arbitrary locations in a Java program. The tool obtains symbolic states from Symbolic PathFinder and uses existing algorithms to infer complex (potentially nonlinear) numerical invariants. Our preliminary results show that SymInfer is effective in using symbolic states to generate precise and useful invariants for proving program safety and analyzing program runtime complexity. We also show that SymInfer outperforms existing invariant generation systems.},
