We begin by defining the completeness threshold, we prove that the complexity of standard SAT-based BMC is doubly exponential and that, consequently, there is a complexity gap of an exponent between this procedure and standard LTL model checking. We discuss ways to bridge this gap.",

abstract="Business' dependency on a software or computer program is getting higher. In such an environment, eliminating security vulnerabilities have become increasingly important and difficult as programs are more complicated and have greater impacts on businesses. We analyzed the security vulnerabilities of code using a symbolic execution engine that tracks data which would kill or might make the program vulnerable. We also present smart fuzzing using the data from the symbolic execution engine, an effective software vulnerability-finding testing that automatically generates inputs that crash or penetrate the program. By using symbolic execution engine, we can produce the automatically-generated data that are strong against vulnerability issues. In the case when program verification tools fail to verify a program, either the program is buggy or the report is a false alarm. In this case, the burden is put on users in manually classifying the report, which is a time-consuming, error-prone task and it does not utilize facts already proven by the analysis. We present a new technique for assisting users in classifying error reports. Our technique computes small, relevant queries presented to a user, which capture exact information that the analysis misses to either discharge or validate the error. In this paper, a methodology proper to detecting the security vulnerability is suggested by engrafting the symbol-based engine into the secure coding. Also, its effect was verified through the security vulnerability inspection test using the suggested symbolic execution engine. A notion of symbolically executing the program has been presented, which is closely related to the normal notion of program execution. It offers the advantage that one symbolic execution may represent a large, usually infinite, class of normal executions. This can be used for great advantages in the program inspecting and debugging.",

title = {Automated Whitebox Fuzz Testing},
booktitle = {},
year = {2008},
month = {November},
abstract = {Fuzz testing is an effective technique for finding security vulnerabilities in software. Traditionally, fuzz testing tools apply random mutations to well-formed inputs of a program and test the resulting values. We present an alternative whitebox fuzz testing approach inspired by recent advances in symbolic execution and dynamic test generation. Our approach records an actual run of the program under test on a well-formed input, symbolically evaluates the recorded trace, and gathers constraints on inputs capturing how the program uses these. The collected constraints are then negated one by one and solved with a constraint solver, producing new inputs that exercise different control paths in the program. This process is repeated with the help of a code-coverage maximizing heuristic designed to find defects as fast as possible. We have implemented this algorithm in SAGE (Scalable, Automated, Guided Execution), a new tool employing x86 instruction-level tracing and emulation for whitebox fuzzing of arbitrary file-reading Windows applications. We describe key optimizations needed to make dynamic test generation scale to large input files and long execution traces with hundreds of millions of instructions. We then present detailed experiments with several Windows applications. Notably, without any format-specific knowledge, SAGE detects the MS07-017 ANI vulnerability, which was missed by extensive blackbox fuzzing and static analysis tools. Furthermore, while still in an early stage of development, SAGE has already discovered 30+ new bugs in large shipped Windows applications including image processors, media players, and file decoders. Several of these bugs are potentially exploitable memory access violations.},
