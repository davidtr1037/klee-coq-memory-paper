\begin{definition}
\label{def:sym-well-formed}
A memory object $(\addr, \size, \smtarray)$ is well-formed if its interval does not wrap around the address space,
\ie $a + \zeroext_{\bvsort{64}}(s)$ does not overflow.
A memory $\symmemory$ is well-formed if all the memory objects are well-formed and there are no memory objects with overlapping address intervals.
A symbolic state $\symstate{\location}{\symlocalstore}{\symstack}{\symmemory}{\pc}$ is well-formed if $\symmemory$ is well-formed.
\end{definition}
