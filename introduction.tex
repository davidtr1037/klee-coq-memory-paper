\section{Introduction}
...

% Context
Trusting symbolic execution implementations.
Remind why a fully verified implementation is too hard to achieve.
Within that field, approach of proof logging.
Mention recent proof logging efforts and tools.

% Gap
The latest realistic implementation of symex (CPP26) supports only
a limited subset.
Challenges in symbolic memory model and formal reasoning.
Example (running)?
Convey the difficulties/challenges in extending to memory support.
(dual representation full/opt)
(data layout, memory objects; many special cases in spec)

Mention some discrepancies in the impl of KLEE (pending PR)
